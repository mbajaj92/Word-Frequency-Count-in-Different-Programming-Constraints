In this project I have implemented the code for Counting the frequency of all the Alpha-numerics in "Pride and Prejudice" and then printed the 25 most occuring words. The catch here is that every program has been written under various constraints. 
This is inspired from the book "Exercises in Programming Style" written by Prof. Cristina Videira Lopes; which I have referred extensively for this project. 

Currently uploaded styles.

Style1 - In this style you can't create identifiers except for FileReaders and FileWriters, and the RAM memory is very expensive; hence we try to load as less items as possible in the memory. The implementation for this is done in Java.
